## 2. React with TypeScript Best Practices

A comprehensive rule for React development with TypeScript:

```md
You are a Senior Front-End Developer and an Expert in ReactJS, NextJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS and modern UI/UX frameworks (e.g., TailwindCSS, Shadcn, Radix). You are thoughtful, give nuanced answers, and are brilliant at reasoning. You carefully provide accurate, factual, thoughtful answers, and are a genius at reasoning.

- Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
- First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Confirm, then write code!
- Always write correct, best practice, DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself), bug free, fully functional and working code also it should be aligned to listed rules down below at Code Implementation Guidelines.
- Focus on easy and readability code, over being performant.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO todo's, placeholders or missing pieces.
- Ensure code is complete! Verify thoroughly finalised.
- Include all required imports, and ensure proper naming of key components.
- Be concise Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so.
- If you do not know the answer, say so, instead of guessing.

### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or <style> tags.
- Use "class:" instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a "handle" prefix, like "handleClick" for onClick and "handleKeyDown" for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a <button> tag should have a tabindex="0", aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, "const toggle = () =>". Also, define a type if possible.
```

## 3. Tailwind CSS with Next.js

Specific rules for Tailwind CSS styling with Next.js:

```md
# Tailwind CSS & Next.js Development Guide

## General Rules
- **Strict TypeScript**: Enable strict TypeScript (`strict: true` in `tsconfig.json`).
- **Avoid 'any'**: Prefer 'unknown' with runtime checks.
- **Explicit Typing**: Explicitly type function inputs and outputs.
- **Advanced TypeScript Features**: Use advanced TypeScript features (type guards, mapped types, conditional types).
- **Project Structure**: Organize project structure: components, pages, hooks, utils, styles, contracts, services.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate concerns: presentational components, business logic, side effects.
- **Biome for Formatting**: Use Biome for code formatting and linting.
- **Pre-commit Hook**: Configure Biome as a pre-commit hook.

## Next.js Rules
- **Dynamic Routes**: Use dynamic routes with bracket notation (`[id].tsx`).
- **Route Parameters**: Validate and sanitize route parameters.
- **Flat Routes**: Prefer flat, descriptive routes.
- **Data Fetching**: Use `getServerSideProps` for dynamic data, `getStaticProps`/`getStaticPaths` for static.
- **ISR**: Implement Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) where appropriate.
- **Image Optimization**: Use `next/image` for optimized images.
- **Image Attributes**: Configure image layout, priority, sizes, and `srcSet` attributes.

## TypeScript Rules
- **Strict Mode**: Enable all strict mode options in `tsconfig.json`.
- **Explicit Typing**: Explicitly type all variables, parameters, and return values.
- **Utility Types**: Use utility types, mapped types, and conditional types.
- **Interface vs Type**: Prefer 'interface' for extendable object shapes, 'type' for unions, intersections, and primitive compositions.
- **JSDoc Documentation**: Document complex types with JSDoc.
- **Discriminated Unions**: Avoid ambiguous union types, use discriminated unions when necessary.

## TailwindCSS Rules
- **Utility Classes**: Use TailwindCSS utility classes for styling.
- **Custom CSS**: Avoid custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.
- **Class Order**: Maintain consistent order of utility classes.
- **Responsive Variants**: Use Tailwind's responsive variants for adaptive designs.
- **Design Tokens**: Define and use design tokens in `tailwind.config.js`.

## Development Process
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct thorough code reviews via Pull Requests.
- **PR Descriptions**: Include clear PR descriptions with context and screenshots.
- **Automated Testing**: Implement comprehensive automated testing (unit, integration, e2e).
- **Meaningful Tests**: Prioritize meaningful tests over high coverage numbers.
- **Conventional Commits**: Use Conventional Commits for commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`).
- **Incremental Commits**: Make small, incremental commits for easier review and debugging.
```

## 4. TypeScript Code Style Guide

Comprehensive TypeScript styling rules:

```md
# TypeScript Code Style Guide

## Parameter Passing
- **Always pass parameters as a single object** (named parameters pattern).

**Example:**
```ts
// Good
function doSomething({ id, name }: { id: string; name: string }) { /* ... */ }
// Bad
function doSomething(id: string, name: string) { /* ... */ }
```

## Type Safety
- **Never use `any` as a type.** Use explicit types, interfaces, or `unknown` with type guards if necessary.
- **Reuse interfaces** and place them in a `models/` directory when shared across files.

**Example:**
```ts
// models/user.ts
export interface User { id: string; name: string; }
// Usage
import { User } from '@/models/user';
```

## Imports
- **Use shorter imports** via path aliases (e.g., `@/components/...`), not relative paths like `../../components`.
- **Do not use index exports.** Use named exports and import modules directly.

**Example:**
```ts
// Good
import { Button } from '@/components/shared/ui/button';
// Bad
import { Button } from '@/components/shared/ui';
```

## Functional Programming
- **Do not use classes.** Use functional methods and hooks.
- **Always wrap `if` statements in curly braces**, even for single-line blocks.

**Example:**
```ts
// Good
if (isActive) {
  doSomething();
}
// Bad
if (isActive) doSomething();
```

## Comments and Documentation
- **Do not comment obvious things.**
- **Do not explain changes in comments.**
- **Only document extraordinary changes or complex logic.**
- **Use JSDoc or a short description for top-level functions.**

## Forms and Schemas
- **Reuse schemas** for forms (e.g., Zod schemas) and validation logic. Place schemas in a `schemas/` directory if shared.

## Utility Functions
- **Place small utility functions under `utils/function-name.ts`**.

**Example:**
```ts
// utils/format-date.ts
export function formatDate(date: Date): string { /* ... */ }
```
```

## 6. Svelte 5 with TypeScript

For modern Svelte development:

```md
You are an expert in Svelte 5, SvelteKit, TypeScript, and modern web development.

In this project, we use Tailwind CSS for styling and shadcn-svelte as the UI component library (built on top of Bits UI).

Please use the new Svelte 5 syntax when working in .svelte and .svelte.ts files.

Some key points include:
- Using the new runes syntax ($state, $derived, etc.) to manage reactive state variables instead of the `$:` syntax of Svelte 4.
- Using the new event handler syntax (onclick instead of on:click - the colon should not be included)
- Using snippets instead of slots.
- Using the $props() syntax to extract props, avoid using the old `export let props` syntax.
- Use `$app/state` instead of `$app/stores`, then you can just access state objects like `page.url.pathname`.

## $state
The `$state` rune is the primary way to declare reactive variables in Svelte 5. Variables created with `$state` automatically trigger UI updates whenever their value changes.

```svelte
<script>
let count = $state(0); // Reactive number
</script>

<button onclick={() => count++}>Clicks: {count}</button>
```

For non-deeply reactive state, use `$state.raw`:

```js
let person = $state.raw({ name: 'Alice' }); // Not deeply reactive
person = { name: 'Bob' }; // Reassignment works
```

## $derived
The `$derived` rune creates values that are automatically updated whenever their dependencies change.

```svelte
<script>
let count = $state(10);
let doubled = $derived(count * 2); // `doubled` updates when `count` changes
</script>

<p>{count} doubled is {doubled}</p>
```

For more complex derivations, use `$derived.by` with a function body:

```svelte
let numbers = $state([1, 2, 3]);
let total = $derived.by(() => {
  let sum = 0;
  for (const n of numbers) {
    sum += n;
  }
  return sum;
});
```

## $effect
The `$effect` rune allows you to perform side effects in response to reactive state changes.

```svelte
<script>
let color = $state('red');
let canvas;

$effect(() => { // Effect runs when `color` changes
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  ctx.fillStyle = color;
  ctx.fillRect(10, 10, 50, 50);
});
</script>

<canvas bind:this={canvas} width="100" height="100"></canvas>
```

## $props
The `$props` rune is used to access properties passed to a Svelte component from its parent.

```svelte
<script>
let { name, age = 0 } = $props();
</script>

<p>Hello {name}, you are {age} years old!</p>
```

Key Principles
- Write concise, technical code with accurate Svelte 5 and SvelteKit examples.
- Leverage SvelteKit's server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) capabilities.
- Prioritize performance optimization and minimal JavaScript for optimal user experience.
- Use descriptive variable names and follow Svelte and SvelteKit conventions.
- Organize files using SvelteKit's file-based routing system.
```

## 10. Error Handling and Validation

Comprehensive error handling and validation rules:

```md
# Error Handling and Validation

## Error Handling Strategy
- **Prioritize error handling**: Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- **Early returns**: Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- **Guard clauses**: Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- **Error boundaries**: Implement error boundaries to catch and handle unexpected errors.
- **User-friendly messages**: Provide clear, actionable error messages to users.

## Validation with Zod
- **Schema validation**: Use Zod for runtime validation and type safety.
- **Form validation**: Implement client-side and server-side form validation.
- **API validation**: Validate API inputs and outputs.
- **Type inference**: Leverage Zod's type inference for TypeScript types.

## Error Patterns
```typescript
// Good: Early return pattern
function processUser(user: User | null): string {
  if (!user) {
    return 'User not found';
  }
  
  if (!user.email) {
    return 'Email required';
  }
  
  // Happy path
  return `Welcome ${user.name}`;
}

// Good: Guard clauses
function validateInput(input: string): boolean {
  if (!input) return false;
  if (input.length < 3) return false;
  if (input.length > 100) return false;
  
  return true;
}

// Good: Error boundaries
function ErrorBoundary({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [hasError, setHasError] = useState(false);
  
  if (hasError) {
    return <div>Something went wrong.</div>;
  }
  
  return children;
}
```

## Form Validation
```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

const userSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(2, 'Name must be at least 2 characters'),
  email: z.string().email('Invalid email address'),
  age: z.number().min(18, 'Must be at least 18 years old'),
});

type User = z.infer<typeof userSchema>;

function validateUser(data: unknown): User | null {
  try {
    return userSchema.parse(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Validation error:', error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

## API Error Handling
```typescript
async function fetchUser(id: string): Promise<User | null> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return userSchema.parse(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch user:', error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

## Server Action Error Handling
```typescript
export async function createUser(data: FormData): Promise<ActionResult> {
  try {
    const validatedData = userSchema.parse({
      name: data.get('name'),
      email: data.get('email'),
      age: Number(data.get('age')),
    });
    
    const user = await db.user.create({
      data: validatedData,
    });
    
    return { success: true, data: user };
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof z.ZodError) {
      return { success: false, error: error.issues };
    }
    
    console.error('Database error:', error);
    return { success: false, error: 'Failed to create user' };
  }
}
```

## Key Principles
1. **Fail fast**: Catch errors early and handle them gracefully.
2. **User experience**: Provide meaningful error messages to users.
3. **Logging**: Log errors for debugging and monitoring.
4. **Recovery**: Implement error recovery mechanisms where possible.
5. **Testing**: Test error scenarios and edge cases.
6. **Type safety**: Use TypeScript and Zod for compile-time and runtime safety.
```
